What do they need the iridium for?\\nIt\\'s a stabilising agent.\\nI\\'m just saying, pick a weekend.\\nI\\'ll fly you to Portland.\\nKeep love alive.\\nIt means the portal won\\'t collapse on itself\\nlike it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nNo hard feelings, Point Break. You\\'ve got a mean swing.\\nAlso, it means the portal can open as wide\\nand stay open as long, as Loki wants.\\nRaise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.\\nThat man is playing Galaga.\\nHe thought we wouldn\\'t notice, but we did.\\nHow does Fury even see these?\\nHe turns.\\nSounds exhausting.\\nThe rest of the raw materials,\\nAgent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.\\nThe only major component he still needs\\nis a power source of high-energy density.\\nSomething to kick-start the Cube.\\nWhen did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?\\nLast night.\\nThe packet, Selvig\\'s notes, the extraction theory papers.\\nAm I the only one who did the reading?\\nDoes Loki need any particular kind of power source?\\nHe would have to heat the Cube to 120-million Kelvin\\njust to break through the Coulomb barrier.\\nUnless Selvig has figured out how to stabilise\\nthe quantum tunnelling effect.\\nWell, if he could do that,\\nhe could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.\\nFinally, someone who speaks English.\\nIs that what just happened?\\nIt\\'s good to meet you, Dr Banner.\\nYour work on antielectron collisions is unparalleled.\\nAnd I\\'m a huge fan of the way you lose control\\nand turn into an enormous green rage-monster.\\nThanks.\\nDr Banner is only here to track the Cube.\\nI was hoping you might join him.\\nI would start with that stick of his.\\nIt may be magical,\\nbut it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.\\nI don\\'t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube.\\nAnd I would like to know how Loki used it\\nto turn two of the sharpest men I know\\ninto his personal flying monkeys.\\nMonkeys? I do not understand.\\nI do.\\nI understood that reference.\\nShall we play, Doctor?\\nThis way, sir.\\nThe gamma readings are definitely consistent\\nwith Selvig\\'s reports of the Tesseract.\\nBut it\\'s going to take weeks to process.\\nIf we bypass their mainframe\\nand direct route to the Homer cluster,\\nwe can clock this at around 600 teraflops.\\nAll I packed was a toothbrush.\\nYou know, you should come by Stark Tower sometime.\\nTop ten floors, all R&D.\\nYou\\'d love it. It\\'s Candy Land.\\nThanks, but the last time I was in New York,\\nI kind of broke Harlem.\\nWell, I promise a stress-free environment.\\nNo tension, no surprises.\\n- Hey! - Nothing?\\nAre you nuts?\\nJury\\'s out.\\nYou really have got a lid on it, haven\\'t you?\\nWhat\\'s your secret?\\nMellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?\\nIs everything a joke to you?\\nFunny things are.\\nThreatening the safety of everyone on this ship\\nisn\\'t funny.\\nNo offence, Doc.\\nIt\\'s all right, I wouldn\\'t have come aboard\\nif I couldn\\'t handle pointy things.\\nYou\\'re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut.\\nAnd you need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark.\\nDo you think I\\'m not?\\nWhy did Fury call us in? Why now? Why not before?\\nWhat isn\\'t he telling us?\\nI can\\'t do the equation unless I have all the variables.\\nYou think Fury\\'s hiding something?\\nHe\\'s a spy. Captain, he\\'s \"the\" spy.\\nHis secrets have secrets.\\nIt\\'s bugging him, too. Isn\\'t it?\\nI just want to finish my work here, and...\\nDoctor?\\n\"A warm light for all mankind.\"\\nLoki\\'s jab at Fury about the Cube.\\nI heard it.\\nI think that was meant for you.\\nEven if Barton didn\\'t tell Loki about the tower,\\nit was still all over the news.\\nThe Stark Tower? That big, ugly\\nbuilding in New York?\\nIt\\'s powered by an arc reactor, a self-sustaining energy source.\\nThat building will run itself for, what, a year?\\nIt\\'s just the prototype.\\nI\\'m kind of the only name in clean energy right now.\\nThat\\'s what he\\'s getting at.\\nSo, why didn\\'t S.H.I.E.L.D. Bring him in on the Tesseract project?\\nWhat are they doing in the energy business\\nin the first place?\\nI should probably look into that once my decryption programme\\nfinishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s secure files.\\nI\\'m sorry. Did you say...\\nJarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.\\nIn a few hours, I\\'ll know every dirty secret\\nS.H.I.E.L.D.

We should follow them.\\nFollowing\\'s not really my style.\\nAnd you\\'re all about style, aren\\'t you?\\nOf the people in this room,\\nwhich one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,\\nand, B, not of use?\\nSteve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you.\\nJust find the Cube.\\nThat\\'s the guy my dad never shut up about?\\nI\\'m wondering if they shouldn\\'t have kept him on ice.\\nThe guy\\'s not wrong about Loki.\\nHe does have the jump on us.\\nWhat he\\'s got is an Acme dynamite kit.\\nIt\\'s going to blow up in his face.\\nAnd I\\'m going to be there when it does.\\nYeah. I\\'ll read all about it.\\nOr you\\'ll be suiting up with the rest of us.\\nYou see, I don\\'t get a suit of armour.\\nI\\'m exposed. Like a nerve.\\nIt\\'s a nightmare.\\nI\\'ve got a cluster of shrapnel trying every second\\nto crawl its way into my heart.\\nThis stops it.\\nThis little circle of light, it\\'s part of me now,\\nnot just armour.\\nIt\\'s a terrible privilege.\\n- But you can control it. - Because I learned how.\\nIt\\'s different.\\nHey, I read all about your accident.\\nThat much gamma exposure should have killed you.\\nSo you\\'re saying that the Hulk...\\nThe other guy saved my life?\\nThat\\'s nice.\\nIt\\'s a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?\\nI guess we\\'ll find out.\\nYou may not enjoy that.\\nAnd you just might.\\nAs soon as Loki took the doctor,\\nwe moved Jane Foster.\\nThey\\'ve got an excellent observatory in Troms.\\nShe was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.\\nHandsome fee, private plane, very remote.\\nShe\\'ll be safe.\\nThank you.\\nIt\\'s no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.\\nI dread what he plans for him once he\\'s done.\\nErik is a good man.\\nHe talks about you a lot.\\nYou changed his life.\\nYou changed everything around here.\\nThey were better as they were.\\nWe pretend on Asgard that we\\'re more advanced\\nbut we come here, battling like bilge snipe.\\n- Like what? - Bilge snipe.\\nYou know, huge, scaly, big antlers.\\n- You don\\'t have those? - I don\\'t think so.\\nWell, they are repulsive.\\nAnd they trample everything in their path.\\nWhen I first came to Earth, Loki\\'s rage followed me here,\\nand your people paid the price.\\nAnd now, again.\\nIn my youth, I courted war.\\nWar hasn\\'t started yet.\\nYou think you could make Loki tell us\\nwhere the Tesseract is?\\nI do not know. Loki\\'s mind is far afield.\\nIt\\'s not just power he craves, it\\'s vengeance, upon me.\\nThere\\'s no pain would prise his need from him.\\nA lot of guys think that\\nuntil the pain starts.\\nWhat are you asking me to do?\\nI\\'m asking, what are you prepared to do?\\nLoki is a prisoner.\\nThen why do I feel like he\\'s the only person on this boat\\nthat wants to be here?\\nThere\\'s not many people who can sneak up on me.\\nBut you figured I\\'d come.\\nAfter.\\nAfter whatever tortures Fury can concoct,\\nyou would appear as a friend, as a balm.\\nAnd I would cooperate.\\nI want to know what you\\'ve done to Agent Barton.\\nI would say I\\'ve expanded his mind.\\nAnd once you\\'ve won,\\nonce you\\'re king of the mountain,\\nwhat happens to his mind?\\nIs this love, Agent Romanoff?\\nLove is for children. I owe him a debt.\\nTell me.\\nBefore I worked for S.H.I.E.L. D... I...\\nWell, I made a name for myself.\\nI have a very specific skill set.\\nI didn\\'t care who I used it for, or on.\\nI got on S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s radar in a bad way.\\nAgent Barton was sent to kill me.\\nHe made a different call.\\nAnd what will you do if I vow to spare him?\\nNot let you out.\\nNo, but I like this.\\nYour world in the balance, and you bargain for one man.\\nRegimes fall every day.\\nI tend not to weep over that. I\\'m Russian.\\nOr I was.\\nAnd what are you now?\\nIt\\'s really not that complicated.\\nI got red in my ledger, I\\'d like to wipe it out.\\nCan you?\\nCan you wipe out that much red?\\nDreykov\\'s daughter,\\nSo Paulo,\\nthe hospital fire?\\nBarton told me everything.\\nYour ledger is dripping. It\\'s gushing red\\nand you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself\\nwill change anything?\\nThis is the basest sentimentality.\\nThis is a child at prayer.\\nPathetic!\\nYou lie and kill\\nin the service of liars and killers.\\nYou pretend to be separate, to have your own code,\\nsomething that makes up for the horrors.\\nBut they are part of you.\\nAnd they will never go away.\\nI won\\'t touch Barton, not until I make him kill you.\\nSlowly, intimately,\\nin every way he knows you fear.\\nAnd then he\\'ll wake just long enough to see his good work\\nand when he screams, I\\'ll split his skull.\\nThis is my bargain, you mewling quim.\\nYou\\'re a monster.\\nOh, no.\\nYou brought the monster.\\nSo, Banner.\\nThat\\'s your play.\\nWhat?\\nLoki means to unleash the Hulk.\\nKeep Banner in the lab. I\\'m on my way.\\nSend Thor as well.\\nThank you\\nfor your cooperation.\\nWhat are you doing, Mr Stark?\\nKind of been wondering the same thing about you.\\nYou\\'re supposed to be locating the Tesseract.\\nWe are. The model\\'s locked\\nand we\\'re sweeping for the signature now.\\nWhen we get a hit,\\nwe\\'ll have the location within half a mile.\\nYeah, then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss.\\nWhat is \"Phase 2\"?\\nPhase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D.

I was pretty well removed.\\nLoki is manipulating you.\\nAnd you\\'ve been doing what, exactly?\\nYou didn\\'t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.\\nYes, and I\\'m not leaving\\nbecause suddenly you get a little twitchy.\\nI\\'d like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.\\nIs using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.\\nBecause of him.\\nMe?\\nLast year, Earth had a visitor from another planet\\nwho had a grudge match that levelled a small town.\\nWe learned that not only are we not alone\\nbut we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.\\nMy people want nothing but peace with your planet.\\nBut you\\'re not the only people out there, are you?\\nAnd you\\'re not the only threat.\\nThe world\\'s filling up with people who can\\'t be matched,\\nthat can\\'t be controlled.\\nLike you controlled the Cube?\\nYour work with the Tesseract\\nis what drew Loki to it, and his allies.\\nIt is a signal to all the realms\\nthat the Earth is ready for a higher form of war.\\nA higher form?\\nYou forced our hand.\\nWe had to come up with something.\\nA nuclear deterrent.\\nBecause that always calms everything right down.\\nRemind me again how you made your fortune, Stark.\\nI\\'m sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep...\\nHold on. How is this now about me?\\nI\\'m sorry, isn\\'t everything?\\nI thought humans were more evolved than this.\\nExcuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?\\nYou treat your champions with such mistrust.\\nAre you boys really that nave?\\nS.H.I.E.L.D. Monitors potential threats.\\nCaptain America\\'s on threat watch?\\nWe all are.\\nWait, you\\'re on that list?\\nAre you above or below angry bees?\\nStark, so help me God, if you make one more wisecrack...\\nThreat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.\\n- Show some respect. - Respect what?\\nTransport Six-Six-Bravo, please relay confirm codes.\\nI\\'ve got you on the computer, but not on the day log.\\nWhat is your haul? Over.\\nArms and ammunition. Over.\\nYou speak of control, yet you court chaos.\\nThat\\'s his M.O., isn\\'t it?\\nI mean, what are we, a team?\\nNo, we\\'re a chemical mixture that makes chaos.\\nWe\\'re a time bomb.\\nYou need to step away.\\nWhy shouldn\\'t the guy let off a little steam?\\nYou know damn well why. Back off!\\nI\\'m starting to want you to make me.\\nYeah.

Like you?\\nYou\\'re a laboratory experiment, Rogers.\\nEverything special about you came out of a bottle.\\nPut on the suit. Let\\'s go a few rounds.\\nYou people are so petty and tiny.\\nYeah, this is a team.\\nAgent Romanoff, would you escort\\nDr Banner back to his...\\nWhere? You rented my room.\\nThe cell was just in case...\\nIn case you needed to kill me.\\nBut you can\\'t. I know, I tried.\\nI got low. I didn\\'t see an end.\\nSo, I put a bullet in my mouth, and the other guy spit it out.\\nSo I moved on.\\nI focused on helping other people. I was good.\\nUntil you dragged me back into this freak show\\nand put everyone here at risk.\\nYou want to know my secret, Agent Romanoff?\\nYou want to know how I stay calm?\\nDr Banner,\\nput down the sceptre.\\nGot it.\\nSorry, kids,\\nyou don\\'t get to see my party trick after all.\\nYou located the Tesseract?\\nI could get there fastest.\\nThe Tesseract belongs on Asgard. No human is a match for it.\\n- You\\'re not going alone. - You\\'re gonna stop me?\\nPut on the suit, let\\'s find out.\\nI\\'m not afraid to hit an old man.\\nPut on the suit.\\nOh, my God.\\nPut on the suit.\\nYeah.\\nAll hands to stations.\\n- Hill! - External detonation.\\nNumber three engine is down.\\nWe\\'ve been hit.\\n- Can they get it running? - Fire in engine three!\\nTalk to me.\\nTurbine looks mostly intact\\nbut it\\'s impossible to get out there to make repairs\\nwhile we\\'re in the air.\\nIf we lose one more engine, we won\\'t be.\\nSomebody\\'s got to get outside and patch that engine.\\n- Stark, you copy that? - I\\'m on it.\\nCoulson, initiate defensive lockdown in the detention section\\nthen get to the armoury.\\nRomanoff?\\nWe\\'re okay.\\nWe\\'re okay, right?\\n- Keep that engine down! - Yes, sir.\\nDetention, wait for cameras to go dark.\\n- Got it. - Stay close.\\nLet\\'s go, Level 4.\\nEngine three. I\\'ll meet you there.\\nDoctor?\\nBruce?\\nYou got to fight it. This is just what Loki wants.\\nWe\\'re going to be okay. Listen to me.\\nAre you hurt?\\nWe\\'re going to be okay. All right?\\nI swear on my life, I will get you out of this.\\nYou will walk away and never ever...\\nYour life?\\nBruce.\\nBring the carrier about to a 1-8-0, heading south!\\n- Take us to the water! - We\\'re flying blind.\\nNavigation\\'s recalibrating after the engine failure.\\nIs the sun coming up?\\n- Yes, sir. - Then put it on the left.\\nGet us over water.\\nOne more turbine goes down, and we drop.\\nThanks.\\nStark!\\nStark, I\\'m here!\\nGood.\\nLet\\'s see what we\\'ve got.\\nI got to get this superconducting coolant system\\nback online\\nbefore I can access the rotors,\\nwork on dislodging the debris.\\nI need you to get to that engine control panel\\nand tell me which relays are in overload position.\\nWhat does it look like in there?\\nIt seems to run on some form of electricity.\\nWell, you\\'re not wrong.\\nWe are not your enemies, Banner.\\nTry to think!\\nOkay, the relays are intact.\\nWhat\\'s our next move?\\nEven if I clear the rotors,\\nthis thing won\\'t re-engage without a jump.\\nI\\'m going to have to get in there and push.\\nIf that thing gets up to speed, you\\'ll get shredded.\\nThat stator control unit can reverse the polarity\\nlong enough to disengage maglev and that could...\\nSpeak English!\\nYou see that red lever?\\nIt will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.\\nStand by it. Wait for my word.\\nWe need full evac on the lower hangar bay.\\nGrenade!\\nWe\\'ve got a perimeter breach!\\nHostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D.

Why?\\nWhat did Loki do to you?\\nHe didn\\'t. I just...\\nNatasha.\\nI\\'ve been compromised.\\nI got red in my ledger.\\nI would like to wipe it out.\\nWas he married?\\nNo.\\nThere was a cellist, I think.\\nI\\'m sorry.\\nHe seemed like a good man.\\nHe was an idiot.\\nWhy? For believing?\\nFor taking on Loki alone.\\nHe was doing his job.\\nHe was out of his league. He should have waited.\\nHe should have...\\nSometimes there isn\\'t a way out, Tony.\\nRight, I\\'ve heard that before.\\nIs this the first time you lost a soldier?\\nWe are not soldiers.\\nI\\'m not marching to Fury\\'s fife.\\nNeither am I.\\nHe\\'s got the same blood on his hands that Loki does.\\nBut right now, we got to put that behind us\\nand get this done.\\nLoki needs a power source.\\nIf we can put together a list...\\nHe made it personal.\\nThat\\'s not the point.\\nThat is the point. That\\'s Loki\\'s point.\\nHe hit us all right where we live. Why?\\nTo tear us apart.\\nYeah, divide and conquer is great\\nbut he knows he has to take us out to win, right?\\nThat\\'s what he wants.\\nHe wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it.\\nHe wants an audience.\\nRight. I caught his act in Stuttgart.\\nYeah, that was just previews. This is opening night.\\nAnd Loki, he\\'s a full-tilt diva, right?\\nHe wants flowers, he wants parades.\\nHe wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered...\\nSon of a bitch.\\nTime to go.\\n- Go where? - I\\'ll tell you on the way.\\nCan you fly one of those jets?\\nI can.\\nYou got a suit?\\nYeah.\\nThen suit up.\\nHey, you guys aren\\'t authorised to be in here.\\nSon, just don\\'t.\\nSir.\\nAgent Hill.\\nThose cards,\\nthey were in Coulson\\'s locker, not in his jacket.\\nThey needed the push.\\nWe have an unauthorised departure from Bay 6.\\nThey found him.\\nGet our communications back up, whatever you have to do.\\n- I want eyes on everything. - Yes, sir.\\nSir, I\\'ve turned off the arc reactor\\nbut the device is already self-sustaining.\\nShut it down, Dr Selvig.\\nIt\\'s too late!\\nShe can\\'t stop now.\\nShe wants to show us something!\\nA new universe.\\nOkay.\\nThe barrier is pure energy.\\nIt\\'s unbreachable.\\nYeah, I got that.\\nPlan B.\\nSir, the Mark 7 is not ready for deployment.\\nThen skip the spinning rims. We\\'re on the clock.\\nPlease tell me you\\'re going to appeal to my humanity.\\nActually, I\\'m planning to threaten you.\\nYou should have left your armour on for that.\\nYeah.\\nIt\\'s seen a bit of mileage,\\nand you\\'ve got the glow stick of destiny.\\nWould you like a drink?\\nStalling me won\\'t change anything.\\nNo, no.

Did you stop for drive-through?\\nSwing up Park. I\\'m going to lay them out for you.\\nSir, we have more incoming.\\nFine. Let\\'s keep them occupied.\\n- Nat? - I see him.\\nWe got to get back up there.\\nStark, are you seeing this?\\nSeeing. Still working on believing.\\nWhere\\'s Banner?
